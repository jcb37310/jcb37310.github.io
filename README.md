Personal Website

My little spot on the web.

For many years, I've had a website at www.jcby.com. That site will go away at the end of 2023. Any further posting will be here, but I do not expect it to be much. This is mainly for truly personal use.

UPDATE to above paragraph. I changed my mind. I am not going to do away with jcby.com. I've changed its format and means of updating and will retain it. The plan to eliminate it was part of a move to get away from paying for email and hosting. But I've decided I can afford to keep doing that.
