  <h1>Jim's Website</h1>
  
  <p>5/29/22. For years I have maintained a website at <a href="//jcby.com">jcby.com</a>. And I will continue that site through 2023&mdash;it's paid up until then. But I'm thinking about making this my only presence on the web after then. It's free and easy to update. We'll see.</p>
<p>1/4/26. As you can see, I never did anything with this webpage. I have continued www.jcby.com as my personal spot on the web. Mainly because my primary email, which I do not intend to change, is tied to that domain. This is just an update if someone happens to stumble over this page and wonders what happened after that 2022 post. Not that I think anyone cares.</p>
